## The Untold Story of the 2018 Olympics Cyberattack, the Most Deceptive Hack in History

This is the blow-by-blow account of how Russian government hackers targeted the Pyeongchang's Winter Olympics in South Korea, shutting down part of its IT infrastructure during the opening ceremony. The most surprising part of this hack is that the perpetrators cleverly hid their provenance, with layers of false flags to deceive investigators looking into the hack. The hackers, for example, used a data-deleting tool used by North Korean government hackers, and password-stealing code previously used by Chinese government hackers in an attempt to lead investigators to point the finger to the wrong country. In this story, an excerpt from his new book Sandworm, Andy Greenberg tells us how researchers were able to unravel the web of planted clues and find the real culprits.

##  The Sinkhole That Saved the Internet

In May of 2017, an unprecedented ransomware outbreak hit hundreds of thousands of computers all over the world, including systems belonging to the UK’s National Health Services, forcing health care facilities to turn patients away and close emergency rooms. The virus was called WannaCry, and its viral spread was stopped by two clever security researchers who realized the malware included a kill-switch. This enthralling piece details for the first time what it was like to stop WannaCry directly from the point of view of the two researchers, Marcus Hutchins—aka MalwareTech—and Jamie Hankins.

## Inside The UAE’s Secret Hacking Team Of American Mercenaries

DarkMatter, the shadowy cybersecurity company from Dubai, has long been under scrutiny for its alleged shady practices. Chris Bing and Joel Schectman published this bombshell of a story that finally showed faces and concrete stories: the company was using former US intelligence operatives to run espionage operations on behalf of the United Arab Emirates government. A former NSA analyst went on the record for this story, providing documents and other data that showed how American DarkMatter employees targeted journalists and human rights workers, sometimes using a sophisticated iPhone hacking tool to hack their targets. The Reuters duo followed up this deep-dive with another scoop just a few days ago, revealing that White House cybersecurity veterans played a key role in building the UAE’s intelligence apparatus in the late 2000s and early 2010s.

##  Beto O’Rourke’s Secret Membership In America’s Oldest Hacking Group

This incredible story about Texas politician Beto O’Rourke’s membership in one of the oldest American hacking collectives, Cult of The Dead Cow, is a wild ride. As part of the hacktivist group in the 1980s, O’Rourke wrote a murder fantasy in which the narrator drives over children, imagined a world without money, and stole long distance phone calls. He didn’t actually hack much, but he was an active member and attended hacker conferences. His membership in the group was kept secret for decades, until Joseph Menn revealed it in this article, part of his book on the hacktivist group. O’Rourke’s presidential bid is over, but, perhaps, his story will help normalize how Americans see hackers in the future.

## Undercover Agents Target Cybersecurity Watchdog

This was legitimately one of the most grotesque stories of the year. Spies working for a private intelligence company targeted researchers at Citizen Lab, a digital rights watchdog known for tracking spyware companies. The spies approached the researchers under false premises and were unmasked when one of the targets, John Scott-Railton, worked with journalist Raphael Satter to set up a sting operation against the spies. When Scott-Railton met in New York City with one of the spies, Satter crashed the meeting along with videomakers to confront the spy. The spy’s operation was so weird and sloppy that Satter described it as “half John Le Carré and half Mr. Bean.”

##  Inside Google’s Team Fighting to Keep Your Data Safe From Hackers

This was a good profile of a little-known Google security team that tracks government hackers: the Threat Analysis Group, or TAG. In this piece, The Wall Street Journal’s Robert McMillan scored one of the first ever interviews with TAG’s leader, Shane Huntley, who is a former Australian government hacker himself. Huntley talked about what his team does and what hackers they track, sharing details about some of the operations they derailed for the first time. (Note: Huntley later came onto our podcast CYBER.)

##  Attacking the Heart of the German Industry

It's always impressive and rewarding when reporters take tools usually reserved for cybersecurity professionals but use them to uncover something journalistically. In this case, a joint investigation by German public broadcasters BR and NDR found that Chinese state-backed hackers had broken into German companies. They didn't do this based entirely on talking to sources, but by scanning company servers for signs of Chinese malware.

"In all cases where Winnti was installed, the malware will respond to our request. This tells us: That company has been hacked," the article reads, referring to the specific strain of malware.

##  A Multimillionaire Surveillance Dealer Steps Out Of The Shadows . . . And His $9 Million WhatsApp Hacking Van

Perhaps the most bizarre cyber story of the year. This is the profile of a shady Israeli surveillance maker, who sells a $9 million hacking van, which is supposed to be able to hack nearby phones equipped with WhatsApp—“the A-Team truck spliced with a Bond car,” as the author of the piece, Thomas Brewster, put it. In the article, the surveillance maker, named Tal Dilian, defended his industry’s reputation, saying people like him, or the controversial spyware maker NSO Group, “are not the policemen of the world, and we are not the judges of the world,” meaning it’s up to their customers to do the right thing, they just provide the tools. Dilian clearly is a believer, as he agreed to show Brewster the van for an accompanying video.

##  These Hackers Made an App That Kills to Prove a Point

Medical devices’ security has been under scrutiny and under suspicion for a few years now. But this story drives home how dangerous flaws in these devices can be. A group of researchers made an app that can remotely control insulin pumps, potentially giving hackers the ability to hurt—and perhaps kill—patients. "We’ve essentially just created a universal remote for every one of these insulin pumps in the world," said one of the researchers in what’s truly a terrifying quote captured by Lily Hay Newman.

## The Inside Story Of The World's Most Dangerous Malware

In 2017, an oil refinery in Saudi Arabia was hit by what some described as the most dangerous malware ever used, which had the ability to interact with the plant’s safety systems, potentially causing physical damage and hurting people in the refinery. At the time, the identity of the victim, as well as many of the details of the attack, stayed out of the public’s view. In this long and well-sourced feature, E&E News’ Blake Sobczak revealed the name of the company hit by the malware, the oil giant Petro Rabigh, the people who investigated it, and how the hackers played cat-and-mouse with attempts to kick them out of the company’s network. This story wasn’t easy, as most of the people and organizations involved declined to talk to Sobczak on the record, as it usually happens in such high-profile cyberattacks.

##  How The U.S. Hacked ISIS

It’s very rare for hackers who work for intelligence agencies—especially those fighting terrorists—to talk to journalists, given that their work is often classified. NPR veteran reporter Dina Temple-Raston somehow convinced several people who worked for the U.S. military on operations to hack ISIS to do just that. In this story, she reveals how the U.S. Cyber Command and the NSA identified and took down key infrastructure used by the terrorist organization at the height of its popularity—an absolute must-read.

##  The Cyber speaks: What will actually happen in 2020

As we approach the end of the year, cybersecurity companies—for some reason I can’t really fathom—rush to compile relatively vague, mostly meaningless predictions of what will happen in the hacking world. It’s a yearly tradition very few cherish. No one made fun of it in such a smart was as Kelly Shortride did in this article on Cyberscoop. Shortridde forced a bot to read more than 1,000 (!) cybersecurity predictions and then come up with its own predictions using machine learning. The results are simply hilarious. “Don’t be chilled by what you don’t know. You ain’t cybersecurity.” Amen, dear bot.

## Tracking Phones, Google Is a Dragnet for the Police

These two companion pieces are as shocking as well reported by veteran Jennifer Valentino-DeVries, someone who was writing about digital surveillance way before many cared about it. In this investigation, she reveals how investigators are using precise locations gathered by Google to track criminals all over America. These investigations relied on a giant, and previously unknown, Google database eerily called Sensorvault, which “turn the business of tracking cellphone users’ locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement,” as the Times put it.

## All The Incredible Ring Scoops All Over The Internet

Ring, Amazon’s dystopian front-door camera surveillance startup, has really been one of the hottest stories of the year. It’s been thoroughly written about and meticulously dissected by so many journalists that it would be almost unfair to single out just one story. So we decided it’s better to name a bunch of them (and forgive us to remind you to read:

##  Kaspersky's 'Slingshot' Report Burned An Isis-focused Intelligence Operation (Cyberscoop)

What is a cybersecurity firm’s responsibility around not exposing certain hacking operations? Here, Cyberscoop showed that sometimes companies do decide to unmask campaigns targeting arguably legitimate threats, such as terrorists. We also explored this dilemma in our feature on Kaspersky Lab a few weeks after Chis Bing and Patrick O’Neill’s scoop.

##  The CIA's Communications Suffered A Catastrophic Compromise. It Started In Iran. (Yahoo News)

The US government and its intelligence apparatus suffered a deadly blow in China in 2011 and 2012, when more than two dozen CIA sources and informants were killed. But it all started in Iran in 2009, when hackers broke into a CIA “internet-based covert communications system,” as revealed in this bombshell report by Zach Dorfman and Jenna McLaughlin.

##  How Persian Gulf Rivals Turned US Media Into Their Battleground (BuzzFeed News)

Sometimes the best weapon a hacker can use is not an exploit or phishing kit, but the media. If you can discredit your enemy through the relatively cheap method of enticing a journalist with a scoop, you’re onto a winning strategy. Just look at how Guccifier 2.0—a persona allegedly created by the Russian government—distributed the hacked Democrats material too.

##  FBI Repeatedly Overstated Encryption Threat Figures To Congress, Public (The Washington Post)

The FBI has been complaining about encryption...well, pretty much since the 1990s. And in the last few years, particularly after Apple refused to help unlock an alleged terrorist’s iPhone, the battle has intensified. This Washington Post scoop showed that the numbers trotted out by FBI officials when talking about how damaging strong encryption is during investigations were overstated and sometimes incorrect. In other words, encryption isn’t as much of an hurdle as the FBI would like us to believe.

##  Google Plans to Launch Censored Search Engine in China, Leaked Documents Reveal (The Intercept)

Ryan Gallagher not only broke the news that Google was developing a search engine for China, one that would censor terms around human rights and protests, but he’s also remained on top of the story. His reporting sparked widespread protests both internally at Google and among human rights organizations, questions at a Congressional hearing, and, just this week, he reported that Google has hit a major roadblock with the project as disputes have grown internally. This story reminded us—once again—that companies that have a good track record for caring about human rights don’t always stay that way, and that a handful of employees speaking up can change the course of a multi-billion company.

##  Google Is Helping the Pentagon Build AI for Drones (Gizmodo)

Speaking of Google employees standing up against a controversial program, this story about the internet giant’s secret Pentagon contract broke long before Googlers organized marches to protest their own company. Kate Conger’s relentless reporting on the story led to Google shutting down the program and was one of the original stories that helped kick off a new wave of protests by Silicon Valley employees against their own companies.

It wasn’t a great year for Facebook’s bosses either. Cambridge Analytica, a constant struggle to moderate content, and some embarrassing breaches affecting millions of people, among a slew of seemingly endless scandals. You may have missed or forgotten this story, but it’s worth your time. Kashmir Hill, with the help of a team of smart researchers, proved how Facebook mines your cell phone’s contact data to suggest new friends on the social network, and to serve you better targeted ads.

##  Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They’re Not Keeping It Secret (The New York Times)

Speaking of apps that know too much...there are only a few outlets with the resources, reach, and dedication to take a story and present it in such a way that the general public can really understand a security issue. This is one of those stories—the sharing of location data lifted by apps may not be a new phenomenon, but the Times team produced the definitive piece tangibly explaining what this means for the privacy of everyone with a smartphone.

## Russian Troll Farm Hijacked American Teen Girls’ Computers for Likes (The Daily Beast)

As a hacker, Kevin Poulsen brings some of the coolest technological approaches into journalism. Here, Poulsen found a dodgy browser extension belonging to Russia’s controversial troll army, the Internet Research Agency. He then bought the domain linked to it, letting him see what sort of data it was collecting, and from where. He found the IRA’s software on computers all over the place. A great reminder to think how can journalists approach a story from a different, technological angle.

This is a great example of that. Former Motherboard editor Matt Braga visited one of the latest victims of government-sponsored hacking, a growing problem that’s putting regular people all over the world in danger.

##  Gray Hat—Marcus Hutchins’ Profile (New York Magazine)

The security researcher better known as MalwareTech helped stop WannaCry, one of the most virally infectious malware outbreaks ever. Months later, the FBI arrested him for a crime he’s accused to have committed when he was a teen. This in-depth profile tries to answer a universal question in the world of cybersecurity: does a hacker hero always have to have a past? And if so, what should authorities do with them?

##  Service Meant to Monitor Inmates’ Calls Could Track You, Too (The New York Times)

File this under “companies you probably never heard of doing sketchy things that can affect us all.” The Times scored another huge scoop revealing that Securus Technologies, a firm that provides and monitors inmates phone calls, was letting pretty much anyone track people’s cell phones for a fee. Thanks to Securus, anyone “can find the whereabouts of almost any cell phone in the country within seconds,” according to the investigation. As we found out later, and rather unsurprisingly, Securus wasn’t securing this data at all.

##  The Untold Story Of NotPetya, The Most Devastating Cyberattack In History (Wired)

The outbreak of destructive malware NotPetya never got the attention it deserved, perhaps because it came a few weeks after the headline-grabbing WannaCry ransomware outbreak. Andy Greenberg makes it justice in this thrilling tale, part of his upcoming book, on how NotPetya crippled the largest shipping company in the world. The only downside of this story is that it will make you want to read more, but you’ll have to wait until the book comes out.

WikiLeaks and Julian Assange’s fall from grace has been documented over the last few years, but this report built on a treasure trove of leaked chat logs, felt like the nail in the coffin. The Intercept revealed how the secret-spilling organization candidly talked about their preference for the Republican party to win the 2016 election, their thoughts on the “bright, well connected, sadistic sociopath” Hillary Clinton, and some unsavory comments about feminist activists.

## Russian Hackers Posed As ISIS To Threaten Military Wives (Associated Press)

The threat of ISIS hackers has often been unjustifiably hyped up. But in this deeply reported story, people like Angela Ricketts show that the threat was real enough for some people. The AP’s Raphael Satter talked to several people targeted by ISIS sympathizers, putting a face to the victims of a scary online campaign. We need more stories that focus on the victims of hacking, this was a great example of that. And Satter and his colleagues at the AP have produced several more in the last few months that are also worth your time.
