## Threat INTel Reports

Archive of publicly available threat/cybercrime INTel reports (mostly APT Reports but not limited to). Useful as a reference when you emulate/simulate threat actors on a daily basis, or you are interested in TTPs/IOCs. Please create an issue if I'm missing a relevant Report.

**Hint**: If you are looking for every type of publicly available documents and notes related to APTs have a look at [APTnotes](https://github.com/kbandla/APTnotes), [aptnotes](https://github.com/aptnotes/data), and [APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin_Collections](https://github.com/CyberMonitor/APT_CyberCriminal_Campagin_Collections). Unfortunately the way they store and sort their data doesn't work for me anymore.

**Note**: You can also find a [page](APT-Groups.md) with an attempt to sort these reports by APT group name, mostly based on the `ThaiCert` [Threat Actor Encyclopedia](reports/2019/88665.pdf) and the [Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/) pages of the MITRE ATT&CK team. This is work in progress and you can find it here: [APT-Groups](APT-Groups.md).

Depending on what you are looking for you may also find this [page](Others.md) useful. Also, check the `References` at the bottom of this page.
